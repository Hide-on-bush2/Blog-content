# H2-The Number System

## Base Conversion

* 1 minute 12 seconds = 72 seconds = 7.2e4 ms
* (7A)_13 = 7 * 13 + 10 = 101
* (7A)_16 = 7 * 16 + 10 = 122
* (7A)_16 = (0111)(1010)_2 = (172)_8
* (1011011)_2 = (133)_8 = (5B)_16
* (678)_10 = (1010100110)_2 = (1246)_8
* (111)_2 + (101)_2 = (100)_2

## Word Explanation

### Infomation

Information can be thought of as the resolution of uncertainty; it is that which answers the question of "What an entity is" and thus defines both its essence and nature of its characteristics. 

信息是我们用来解决不确定性问题的工具

### Positional Notation

Positional notation (or place-value notation, or positional numeral system) denotes usually the extension to any base of the Hindu–Arabic numeral system (or decimal system). More generally, a positional system is a numeral system in which the contribution of a digit to the value of a number is the product of the value of the digit by a factor determined by the position of the digit.

位置系统（Positional Notation）跟十进制数字系统一样，都是一种数字系统，是对十进制数字系统的拓展

### Algorithm

In mathematics and computer science, an algorithm (/ˈælɡərɪðəm/ (About this soundlisten)) is a finite sequence of well-defined, computer-implementable instructions, typically to solve a class of problems or to perform a computation.[1][2] Algorithms are always unambiguous and are used as specifications for performing calculations, data processing, automated reasoning, and other tasks.

算法是我们用来解决一定问题的指令序列的集合

### Software Bug

A software bug is an error, flaw or fault in a computer program or system that causes it to produce an incorrect or unexpected result, or to behave in unintended ways. 

软件错误是指计算机程序或系统中的错误，缺陷或故障，导致其产生不正确或意外的结果，或行为异常。
