# H1-Introduction to Software Engineering

## Computer

A **computer** is a machine that can be instructed to carry out [sequences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequence) of [arithmetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic) or [logical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_algebra) operations automatically via [computer programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_programming). Modern computers have the ability to follow generalized sets of operations, called *[programs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_program).* These programs enable computers to perform an extremely wide range of tasks. A "complete" computer including the [hardware](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_hardware), the [operating system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system) (main [software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software)), and [peripheral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral) equipment required and used for "full" operation can be referred to as a **computer system**. This term may as well be used for a group of computers that are connected and work together, in particular a [computer network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_network) or [computer cluster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_cluster).

电子计算机（亦称电脑）是利用数字电子技术，根据一系列指令指示并且自动执行任意算术或逻辑操作串行的设备。通用计算机因有能遵循被称为“程序”的一般操作集的能力而使得它们能够执行极其广泛的任务。

## Computer science

**Computer science** is the study of [computation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computation) and [information](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information).[[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science#cite_note-1)[[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science#cite_note-2) Computer science deals with [theory of computation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_computation), [algorithms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm), [computational problems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_problem) and the design of [computer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer) systems [hardware](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_hardware), [software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software) and applications.[[3\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science#cite_note-3)[[4\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science#cite_note-4) Computer science addresses both human-made and natural [information](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information) processes, such as [communication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communication), [control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_flow), [perception](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_vision), [learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_learning_theory) and [intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence) especially in human-made [computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computing) systems and machines.[[5\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science#cite_note-Denning_cs_discipline-5)[[6\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science#cite_note-6)[[7\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science#cite_note-7) According to [Peter Denning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_J._Denning), the fundamental question underlying computer science is, *What can be automated?*

计算机科学（英语：computer science，有时缩写为CS）是系统性研究信息与计算的理论基础以及它们在计算机系统中如何实现与应用的实用技术的学科。

## Software

**Computer software**, or simply **software**, is a collection of [data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_(computing)) or [computer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer) instructions that tell the computer how to work. This is in contrast to [physical hardware](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_hardware), from which the system is built and actually performs the work. In [computer science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science) and [software engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_engineering), computer software is all [information](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information) processed by [computer systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_system), [programs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_program) and [data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data). Computer software includes [computer programs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_program), [libraries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library_(computing)) and related non-executable [data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_(computing)), such as [online documentation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_documentation) or [digital media](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_media). Computer hardware and software require each other and neither can be realistically used on its own.

软件（英语：software）是一系列按照特定顺序组织的电脑数据和指令，是电脑中的非有形部分。电脑中的有形部分称为硬件，由电脑的外壳及各零件及电路所组成。电脑软件需有硬件才能运作，反之亦然，软件和硬件都无法在不互相配合的情形下进行实际的运作。

## Software engineering

**Software engineering** is the systematic application of [engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering) approaches to the [development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_development) of [software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software).[[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_engineering#cite_note-BoDu04-1)[[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_engineering#cite_note-ACM_2020-2)[[3\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_engineering#cite_note-Laplante_2007-3) Software engineering is a [computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computing) discipline.

软件工程是一门研究和应用如何以系统性的、规范化的、可定量的过程化方法去开发和维护软件，以及如何把经过时间考验而证明正确的管理技术和当前能够得到的最好的技术方法结合起来的学科。它涉及到程序设计语言、数据库、软件开发工具、系统平台、标准、设计模式等方面。

## Alan Turing

**Alan Mathison Turing** [OBE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Officer_of_the_Order_of_the_British_Empire) [FRS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fellow_of_the_Royal_Society) ([/ˈtjʊərɪŋ/](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/English); 23 June 1912 – 7 June 1954) was an English mathematician, [computer scientist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_scientist), [logician](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic), [cryptanalyst](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptanalysis), philosopher, and [theoretical biologist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_and_theoretical_biology).[[6\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing#cite_note-6)[[7\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing#cite_note-whoswho-7) Turing was highly influential in the development of [theoretical computer science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theoretical_computer_science), providing a formalisation of the concepts of [algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm) and [computation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computation) with the [Turing machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_machine), which can be considered a model of a [general-purpose computer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General-purpose_computer).[[8\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing#cite_note-frs-8)[[9\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing#cite_note-AFP-9)[[10\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing#cite_note-10) Turing is widely considered to be the father of theoretical computer science and [artificial intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence).[[11\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing#cite_note-11) Despite these accomplishments, he was never fully recognised in his home country during his lifetime due to the prevalence of [homophobia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homophobia) [at the time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_LGBT_history_in_the_United_Kingdom#20th_century) and because much of his work was covered by the [Official Secrets Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Official_Secrets_Act).

艾伦·麦席森·图灵，OBE，FRS（英语：Alan Mathison Turing，又译阿兰·图灵，Turing也常翻译成涂林或者杜林，1912年6月23日－1954年6月7日）是英国计算机科学家、数学家、逻辑学家、密码分析学家和理论生物学家，他被誉为计算机科学与人工智能之父。

## Moora's law

**Moore's law** is the observation that [the number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transistor_count) of [transistors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transistor) in a dense [integrated circuit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_circuit) (IC) doubles about every two years. Moore's law is an [observation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observation) and [projection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forecasting) of a historical trend. Rather than a [law of physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_law), it is an [empirical relationship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empirical_relationship) linked to [gains from experience](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wright's_Law) in production.

摩尔定律（英语：Moore's law）是由英特尔（Intel）创始人之一戈登·摩尔提出的。其内容为：集成电路上可容纳的晶体管数目，约每隔两年便会增加一倍；经常被引用的“18个月”，是由英特尔首席执行官大卫·豪斯（David House）提出：预计18个月会将芯片的性能提高一倍（即更多的晶体管使其更快），是一种以倍数增长的观测。
